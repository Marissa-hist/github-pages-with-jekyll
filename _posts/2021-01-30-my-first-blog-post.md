# **Marissa's Books of the Year (2019 edition)**

It’s that time of the year again! If you’re a bibliophile like me, then December is the time of year when all the best of the best book lists come out, summing up the year’s new, noteworthy, and excellent reads within and across literary genres. In honor of this, I thought I’d share my own personal “best of 2019” reads, with a brief blurb about why the book means so much to me.

*1. To Be Taught, If Fortunate by Becky Chambers*

WOW. Just wow. This novella features four astronauts who set out on a citizen-funded mission of space exploration and research, only to discover that they may not be able to return to the same Earth that they left behind. Beautiful meditation on science, space exploration, and the nature of humanity (and change!). I can't recommend this book enough. Hands down the best book I’ve read this year. Becky Chambers writes such compelling, complex, and diverse characters, too. Just read it, I promise you’ll love it.

*2. On Fire: The Burning Case for a Green New Deal by Naomi Klein*

If you are going to read one nonfiction book this year, you might want to consider this one. In a series of different essays, Klein eloquently and passionately lay outs the magnitude of the climate crisis facing us and what we can do to face this head-on, with insights into how to overcome the prevailing obstacles in our way.

*3. Exhalation: Stories by Ted Chiang*

Ted Chaing does it again! This follow-up to his acclaimed first collection, Story of Your Life and Others, is really, really good. Is it as good as his first one? Hard to say. But regardless, each of these stories brings something to the table in their exploration of how humans relate to and are shaped by the technologies around them. Whether it is a fabric seller traveling through time in Baghdad to grapple with his past mistakes and second chances, an alien scientist dissecting his own brain and making a shocking discovery of universal magnitude, or a group of programmers and caretakers who raise cute little digital robots called digients (imagine something like a Neopet, but more dynamic and interactive), only to struggle to save these AIs from obsolescence. From struggling with the meaning of free will to evaluating the function of digital memories, Chiang’s stories grapple with big questions, ideas, and paradoxes. Plus you will probably find yourself getting suddenly emotional. His writing has a habit of sneaking up on you like that.

*4. Manual for Survival: A Chernobyl Guide to the Future by Kate Brown*

I had never read any of Kate Brown’s other works before I picked up a copy of this book, but I was immediately entranced by her writing. As someone who has two degrees in history, I am always looking for historians who can write compellingly, movingly, and with precision about history as both past and present, and about historical inquiry as a dynamic and reflective process. She accomplishes this with aplomb, while also revealing the staggering impacts of the Chernobyl disaster up to this present day. Just as much an environmental history as a cultural or political one, this book will keep you riveted until the final page. 

*5. Women Talking by Miriam Toews*

Warning: this is not a light read. Based on a true story, the novel features a group of women living in a remote Mennonite colony who, after learning that it is the men of their community who have perpetrated the repeated and systemic sexual assaults on women in the community over the last two years, face an agonizing choice: stay in the community and fight back, or leave. The story unfolds through the minutes of their secret sessions in a hay loft, transcribed by a sympathetic male community member who can write, as women in the colony are kept illiterate.  

*6. Broken Stars: Contemporary Chinese Science Fiction in Translation by Ken Liu*

So I have to admit, I am on a mission to read as much international science fiction produced by authors around the globe as I can. This book offers a fascinating glimpse into the range of Chinese science fiction writings produced in the 2010s, and includes three essays which provide some context for understanding the state of science and speculative fiction in China today. As a follow up to his previous collection of translated works, Invisible Planets, this anthology is an excellent read for any sci-fi fans looking to expand their horizons. I have to thank Ken Liu for his tremendous efforts in making Chinese science fiction accessible to readers in the United States.

*7. Good Talk: A Memoir in Conversations by Mira Jacob*

This is a fantastic graphic memoir which explores urgent questions of identity and belonging in the United States. Mira details the complicated conversations which emerge between her and her half-Indian, half-Jewish six-year-old son following the 2016 election, while reflecting back on the formative conversations and experiences in her life which educated her about race, sexuality, and love. Her publisher, Penguin Random House, describes the book as a “love letter to the art of conversation.” Mira’s prose is sharp, eloquent, and precise, and the art is fantastic. You will fall in love with her and her family. I know I did.

I should add that while I have read a LOT of amazing books this year, not all of them were published in 2019. The list above is a snapshot of my favorite books published this year that I was lucky enough to read.

Then I’d encourage you to go ahead and make your own list and share it with others. ‘Tis the season of giving – so let others know what books made waves for you in 2019.
